# Communiteer

### What is Communiteer?
Communiteer was developed for the 2020 SHS Hackathon. It was designed as a website to connect volunteer event coordinators in our community to those who wanted to volunteer. It accomplished this task by providing a public events page where volunteering coordinators would be able to put up their events and volunteers could go through the events to see any that interested them.
